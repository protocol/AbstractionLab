## Creating the open problem statement

The purpose of the open problem statement is twofold.  Firstly, it should convince the reader that the problem you are presenting is worth working on.  Secondly, it should provide enough background and understanding of the problem that all design decisions and requirements are comprehensively described and motivated.  Feel free to deviate from the following template if you prefer, or answer the following questions as succinctly as possible for an easy open problem statement.

While this template was made to support the RFP program, the open problem statements themselves are purely for the benefit of the community, and there is no obligation to make or request an RFP for each open problem.
