## `AbstractionLab`

### Mission & Vision

AbstractionLab is home to several projects exploring the future of decentralization, and how knowledge graphs and computations on knowledge can be performed in a decentralized fashion. 

AbstractionLab researchers have also worked on projects exploring the future of decentralized infrastructure, and are presently applying their findings to questions of optimal resource allocation in distributed systems.

## Research

### Open Problems

Open Problems can be posted [here](https://github.com/protocol/AbstractionLab/tree/main/OPEN_PROBLEMS) using [this template](https://github.com/protocol/AbstractionLab/commit/5660a19a0c3ec319d764550be0d6b9a87f502c8e). Open Problems can be formulated and improved via discussion on the [AbstractionLab Discussion Board](https://github.com/protocol/AbstractionLab/discussions).

### Projects 

- [The Underlay](https://research.protocol.ai/talks/the-underlay-a-distributed-public-knowledge-graph/)
- [The Project Formerly Known as the Inter-Cranial Abstraction System](https://research.protocol.ai/talks/the-inter-cranial-abstraction-system-icas/)
- [Decentralized Energy](https://research.protocol.ai/talks/decentralized-energy-grid-a-protocol-labs-independent-research-project/) (rusticating)

### RFPs
  
 As we develop and post RFPs, they will be posted in [this github repo](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs).
  
### Collaborations
  
We are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields of interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships. Please check out the [PL Research website](https://research.protocol.ai/outreach/) for further details and application instructions.

## Community

Please join us for discussion on anything in the AbstractionLab sphere on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/protocol/AbstractionLab/discussions/)

We also host the [PL Research Saloon](https://github.com/protocol/AbstractionLab/discussions/1), a researcher-led discussion of various top-of-mind issues. 
  
## Publications, Talks, & Tutorials
